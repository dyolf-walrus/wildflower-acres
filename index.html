        <p>Founded by Tomas and Georgia Bleuet, Wildflower Acres is devoted to top-quality horse training and breeding. Tomas focuses on dressage with his warmbloods, mostly Knabstruppers, but he also has some interest in show jumping. Georgia enjoys the challenge of training wild mustangs as well as breeding mules, and is experienced in western disciplines.
        <br>Wildflower Acres operates in the <a href="https://discord.gg/kN5t7FP9BS">Simquestria discord server</a>. I am _bleuet on discord if you ever need to reach me!
